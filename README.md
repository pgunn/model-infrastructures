# model-infrastructures
Descriptions of model infrastructures, useful for SRE/NRE/... education

Each directory in the toplevel describes a distinct model infrastructure.
We do not presently specify a format for the directories.

# If you use any of these
It would be appreciated, but not required, that you do one or both of:
1) Inform Pat Gunn <pgunn01@gmail.com> that you find it useful
2) Do a pull request to add any modifications you think others might like

Enjoy!
